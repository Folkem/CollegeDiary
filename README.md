# PGFK unofficial web-app diary!

## Welcome to the college-diary.edu project!

This project is a college diploma project, which may or may not in future 
become the third web-application of the PGFK UzhNU College!
The main goal of this app is to facilitate and migrate most of the paper-based 
college work, like journaling lessons and grades, trusting by word or relying 
on 3rd party services (like Classroom, or even messengers) for tracking 
homeworks, lesson and call schedules and some triffles, to the cloud. 
Primarly it is going to be a web-app, but mobile app has also chances to 
appear later on.

_This is first web-app project, and first project of this scale, for the 
author, Folkem. If it's ever going to be made public, it will be free to 
suggestions!_
